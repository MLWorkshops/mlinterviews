The hidden layers allow the neural network to learn complex relationships between the input features to help it make predictions. See Figure 1 for an example of a neural network."

The choice of initial values is very important. If all values are the same, then the outputs to each hidden layer will be the same. This will prevent each neuron in the hidden layer from learning anything useful. To prevent this problem, the weights and biases are initialized to small values. Let's initialize our neural network."

    "In this function, I update the current weights and biases with new weights and biases for each layer using the gradients that were calculated during back propogation. This function takes an additional argument, called the learning rate. As you can see, the gradients are multiplied by the learning rate. Therefore, this parameter determines how fast the model can update its parameters. The learning rate basically controls the step size, as shown in the image above. If the learning rate is large, the model will take large steps as it tries to find the optimal fit. If the learning rate is small, the model will take small steps in the direction of the optimal fit. If the learning rate it too large, the model could bounce back and forth across the optimal fit without finding the best set of values. But, if the learning rate is too small, it could take the model forever to find the best fit. Therefore, the learning rate needs to be iteratively adjusted to find the best value for a given problem."
