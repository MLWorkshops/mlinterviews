## Outline

1. Types of roles

2. Types of interviews for the Data Science role.

3. Specific questions

  - 3A. Data engineering (mostly with SQL)
  - 3B. Foundational, classical and statistical ML
  - 3D. Deep learning
  - 3C. ML Dev Ops or ML deployment


### Types of Roles

It is important to ask yourself:  what type of role am I looking for and why?

- Background: Software engineer. Generally focusing on software, systems, architecture, applications. Roles: Data Engineer or ML Engineer.

- Background: PhD in a scientific field. Working with R/Matlab/Python/SQL for analyzing and visualizing data. Using Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and PyTorch for making predictions. Data Scientist.

- Background: SQL expert. Great at making visualizations and presentations and working with business partners to find requirements and analyze data. Data Analyst. 

These are broad generalizations, but are a kind of way of categorizing the types of jobs that are out there. Some roles are more software and systems oriented in terms of data manipulation, setting up databases and ETLs. Some are more machine-learning model training oriented.
