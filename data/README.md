It fell as if falling from an invisible opening in the sky... the night was a crystal clear night sky  so no clouds or precipitation to obstruct our view and the object was closer than any I have ever witnessed before. The way the object fell was too slow to be a meteor or falling star, also noting that there was no “light trail” following behind the object as it fell. We watched it fall for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the dark night sky somewhere close to the earth surface.  It was the strangest light; object; ufo... I have encountered and felt a duty to report it.",2019-12-22T00:00:00,37.343151515151526,-77.408581818182
